### Entry properties

  - Attributes which ends with `*_url` should point to API actions
  - Attributes which ends with `*_html_url` should point to pages in application

### Entry actions

  - Please sort entry actions (links) in the following order:
    - entry attributes
    - nested entries
    - urls
    - dates

  - Mark not implemented API actions with `âœ–` at the end of action name
